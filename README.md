Code Jam is back in action, challenging professional and student programmers around the globe to solve algorithmic puzzles. 


### What's involved with Code Jam?
Code Jam begins with a Qualification Round that is available for twenty-seven hours. Multiple online rounds then lead up to
the Code Jam World Finals in August, during which the top twenty-five Code Jammers and last year's champion will compete for
the title of Code Jam World Champion and a grand prize of $15,000.
